## 2026-02-16 20:40 CST - Story 6.1
- Implemented project scaffolding from developer profile
- Created `src/scaffolding/generator.ts` — main scaffolding module with `scaffoldProject()` entry point
- Created `src/scaffolding/generator.test.ts` — 56 unit tests covering all profile combinations
- Files created: `src/scaffolding/generator.ts`, `src/scaffolding/generator.test.ts`
- **What was implemented:**
  - Profile-driven directory generation (base, frontend, backend, monorepo dirs)
  - package.json generation with framework deps, test runner, linter scripts
  - tsconfig.json generation with JSX support for React-based frameworks
  - Linter config generation (eslint.config.js, biome.json; oxlint is zero-config)
  - Test runner config generation (vitest.config.ts, jest.config.js)
  - CI config generation (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI) with package-manager-specific commands
  - .gitignore generation with standard entries
  - Git repo initialization with initial commit using profile name as author
  - Idempotency: won't overwrite existing files or re-init existing repos
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - scaffoldProject() takes a `skipGitInit` option for testability — avoids git init in test tmpDirs
  - Config generators return null when the feature is "none" or zero-config (like oxlint)
  - CI config uses filepath (with subdirs) vs filename for files like `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  - execFileSync with env override for GIT_AUTHOR_NAME/GIT_COMMITTER_NAME works well for attribution
  - Frontend framework list for JSX detection: next, remix, vite-react, angular
