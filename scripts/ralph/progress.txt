## Codebase Patterns
- OpenClaw modules are deeply interconnected — almost every module imports from 3+ other modules
- Self-contained files from OpenClaw (can be copied as-is): version.ts, shared/chat-content.ts, shared/chat-envelope.ts, shared/entry-metadata.ts, shared/model-param-b.ts, shared/node-match.ts, shared/pid-alive.ts, shared/subagents-format.ts, logging/levels.ts, logging/state.ts
- Deeply coupled modules that need rewriting: config/ (imports from plugins, routing, infra, agents), logging/ (imports from config, terminal, infra), security/ (imports from plugins, agents, config, pairing), channels/registry.ts (imports from plugins/runtime)
- The channel registry in OpenClaw uses a plugin system — Boop replaces this with a simple static registry for telegram + whatsapp
- OpenClaw uses oxlint + oxfmt for linting/formatting — must scope oxlint to src/ to avoid scanning node_modules
- OpenClaw uses vitest with forks pool — kept this pattern
- Type declarations in src/types/ are module augmentations for npm packages without TS types
- CLI uses options (--profile, --status, etc.) not subcommands — handleCli() exported separately for testing
- @clack/prompts used for interactive mode — dynamic import to avoid loading when not needed
- Logger class uses child() pattern for context overrides — avoids passing context through every call
- Retry utility uses exponential backoff with jitter by default — set jitter: false and low initialDelayMs for tests
- Shared types: PipelineState, DeveloperProfile, Story, Prd, LogEntry — all in src/shared/types.ts

## 2026-02-16 14:30 - Story 1.1
- What was implemented:
  - Forked OpenClaw (cloned from github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git)
  - Stripped ALL deeply coupled modules: plugins, plugin-sdk, canvas-host, discord, slack, line, signal, imessage, web, pairing, link-understanding, media-understanding, macos, daemon, terminal, tui, wizard, polls, auto-reply, cron, node-host, markdown, acp, commands, compat, infra, memory, providers, routing
  - Kept self-contained shared utilities from OpenClaw (subagents-format, chat-content, chat-envelope, entry-metadata, model-param-b, node-match, pid-alive)
  - Kept logging/levels.ts and logging/state.ts from OpenClaw
  - Kept src/types/ type declarations (proper-lockfile, qrcode-terminal)
  - Created clean foundation modules: index.ts, cli/program.ts, version.ts, config/index.ts, logging/index.ts, channels/registry.ts, channels/whatsapp/index.ts, channels/telegram/index.ts, gateway/server.ts, agents/index.ts, browser/index.ts, hooks/index.ts, process/index.ts, security/index.ts, sessions/index.ts, tts/index.ts, shared/index.ts
  - Configured package.json for boop (stripped to essential deps), tsconfig.json, tsdown.config.ts, vitest.config.ts, vitest.unit.config.ts, pnpm-workspace.yaml
  - Created .gitignore
  - Created test infrastructure: test/setup.ts, 3 test files (version, registry, program) with 7 passing tests
- Files changed: ~50 files created/modified
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - OpenClaw's codebase is too coupled to surgically preserve — modules must be reimplemented for Boop's simpler architecture
  - The config/paths.ts depends on infra/home-dir.ts which is self-contained but the config types barrel re-exports 30+ sub-type files
  - Keep oxlint scoped to src/ in package.json scripts
  - OpenClaw's channel registry requires the plugin runtime — replaced with static registry
  - Commander 14.x works well with ESM and .action(async ...)

## 2026-02-16 15:22 - Story 1.2
- What was implemented:
  - Restructured CLI from subcommands to options: --profile, --status, --review, --resume, --autonomous
  - Added optional [idea] positional argument that passes to pipeline
  - Interactive mode via @clack/prompts when no args/flags provided — prompts for idea
  - Exported handleCli() and CliOptions for testability
  - Updated tests: 10 tests covering all flags, idea passing, autonomous mode, priority order
- Files changed:
  - src/cli/program.ts — rewrote from subcommand-based to option-based CLI
  - src/cli/program.test.ts — expanded from 2 to 10 tests
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Commander options (.option()) are better than subcommands for flags like --status/--resume that modify the default behavior
  - @clack/prompts text() validate callback receives possibly-undefined value — guard with `!value ||` check
  - `pnpm dev --` double-dash handling is tricky — use `npx tsx src/index.ts` for direct testing
  - handleCli is exported separately from buildProgram for unit testing without Commander parsing

## 2026-02-16 15:45 - Story 1.3
- What was implemented:
  - Created src/shared/types.ts — PipelineState, PipelinePhase, PIPELINE_PHASES, DeveloperProfile, Story, Prd, LogLevel, LogEntry
  - Created src/shared/logger.ts — Logger class with JSON file output (~/.boop/logs/boop-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl) and human-readable console output ([phase] message). Supports child() for context overrides, configurable min level.
  - Created src/shared/retry.ts — retry() with configurable maxRetries, exponential backoff, jitter, maxDelayMs, isRetryable predicate, onRetry callback. RetryError class for exhausted retries.
  - Updated src/shared/index.ts — re-exports all new types, Logger, createLogger, retry, RetryError
  - Created 25 tests across 3 test files: types (6), logger (11), retry (8)
- Files changed:
  - src/shared/types.ts — new (pipeline state, developer profile, story format, log entry types)
  - src/shared/logger.ts — new (structured JSON + console logger)
  - src/shared/retry.ts — new (retry with exponential backoff)
  - src/shared/index.ts — updated re-exports
  - src/shared/types.test.ts — new (6 tests)
  - src/shared/logger.test.ts — new (11 tests)
  - src/shared/retry.test.ts — new (8 tests)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Logger silently drops file write errors to avoid crashing pipeline over logging — good pattern for non-critical I/O
  - Retry tests with real delays are slow — use initialDelayMs: 1 and jitter: false in tests
  - LogLevel type defined in shared/types.ts (not from logging/levels.ts which uses OpenClaw's tslog-centric ordering)
  - fs.mkdirSync with recursive: true is safe to call repeatedly — no need to check existence first
