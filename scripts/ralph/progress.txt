## Codebase Patterns
- OpenClaw modules are deeply interconnected — almost every module imports from 3+ other modules
- Self-contained files from OpenClaw (can be copied as-is): version.ts, shared/chat-content.ts, shared/chat-envelope.ts, shared/entry-metadata.ts, shared/model-param-b.ts, shared/node-match.ts, shared/pid-alive.ts, shared/subagents-format.ts, logging/levels.ts, logging/state.ts
- Deeply coupled modules that need rewriting: config/ (imports from plugins, routing, infra, agents), logging/ (imports from config, terminal, infra), security/ (imports from plugins, agents, config, pairing), channels/registry.ts (imports from plugins/runtime)
- The channel registry in OpenClaw uses a plugin system — Boop replaces this with a simple static registry for telegram + whatsapp
- OpenClaw uses oxlint + oxfmt for linting/formatting — must scope oxlint to src/ to avoid scanning node_modules
- OpenClaw uses vitest with forks pool — kept this pattern
- Type declarations in src/types/ are module augmentations for npm packages without TS types

## 2026-02-16 14:30 - Story 1.1
- What was implemented:
  - Forked OpenClaw (cloned from github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git)
  - Stripped ALL deeply coupled modules: plugins, plugin-sdk, canvas-host, discord, slack, line, signal, imessage, web, pairing, link-understanding, media-understanding, macos, daemon, terminal, tui, wizard, polls, auto-reply, cron, node-host, markdown, acp, commands, compat, infra, memory, providers, routing
  - Kept self-contained shared utilities from OpenClaw (subagents-format, chat-content, chat-envelope, entry-metadata, model-param-b, node-match, pid-alive)
  - Kept logging/levels.ts and logging/state.ts from OpenClaw
  - Kept src/types/ type declarations (proper-lockfile, qrcode-terminal)
  - Created clean foundation modules: index.ts, cli/program.ts, version.ts, config/index.ts, logging/index.ts, channels/registry.ts, channels/whatsapp/index.ts, channels/telegram/index.ts, gateway/server.ts, agents/index.ts, browser/index.ts, hooks/index.ts, process/index.ts, security/index.ts, sessions/index.ts, tts/index.ts, shared/index.ts
  - Configured package.json for boop (stripped to essential deps), tsconfig.json, tsdown.config.ts, vitest.config.ts, vitest.unit.config.ts, pnpm-workspace.yaml
  - Created .gitignore
  - Created test infrastructure: test/setup.ts, 3 test files (version, registry, program) with 7 passing tests
- Files changed: ~50 files created/modified
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - OpenClaw's codebase is too coupled to surgically preserve — modules must be reimplemented for Boop's simpler architecture
  - The config/paths.ts depends on infra/home-dir.ts which is self-contained but the config types barrel re-exports 30+ sub-type files
  - Keep oxlint scoped to src/ in package.json scripts
  - OpenClaw's channel registry requires the plugin runtime — replaced with static registry
  - Commander 14.x works well with ESM and .action(async ...)
