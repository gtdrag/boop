description: >
  Six tiers of increasing project complexity. Each tier tests whether Boop
  can plan, build, and review a progressively harder project. After each
  tier, the system proposes self-improvements (prompt evolution, heuristics)
  for human approval.

tiers:
  - id: t1-todo-app
    label: "T1: To-do App"
    level: 1
    idea: >
      A simple to-do list application with React and local storage.
      Users can add, complete, and delete tasks. No backend needed.
    stack: "React + local storage, no backend"
    rationale: >
      Absolute minimum — can Boop scaffold and build anything at all?
      No server, no database, just a single-page React app.
    successCriteria:
      minPhaseReached: BUILDING
      planningMustPass: true

  - id: t2-notes-app
    label: "T2: Notes App"
    level: 2
    idea: >
      A notes application with React frontend, Express backend, and SQLite
      database. Full CRUD operations: create, read, update, delete notes.
      Notes have a title and body. Simple REST API.
    stack: "React + Express + SQLite, CRUD"
    rationale: >
      Adds a backend and database layer. Tests that Boop can plan and
      build a full-stack application with data persistence.
    profileOverrides:
      backendFramework: express
      database: sqlite
    successCriteria:
      minPhaseReached: BUILDING
      planningMustPass: true

  - id: t3-blog-with-auth
    label: "T3: Blog with Auth"
    level: 3
    idea: >
      A blog platform with Next.js frontend, Express API, and PostgreSQL
      database. Features: user authentication (email/password), blog post
      CRUD, admin panel for managing posts, public-facing blog with
      pagination. Database migrations for schema management.
    stack: "Next.js + Express + PostgreSQL"
    rationale: >
      Adds authentication, database migrations, and an admin interface.
      Tests multi-concern planning and role-based access patterns.
    profileOverrides:
      frontendFramework: next
      backendFramework: express
      database: postgresql
    successCriteria:
      minPhaseReached: BUILDING
      planningMustPass: true

  - id: t4-ecommerce
    label: "T4: E-commerce Storefront"
    level: 4
    idea: >
      An e-commerce storefront with Next.js, PostgreSQL, and Stripe
      integration. Features: product catalog with categories, shopping
      cart with session persistence, checkout flow with Stripe payments,
      order history, inventory management, product search and filtering.
    stack: "Next.js + PostgreSQL + Stripe"
    rationale: >
      Multiple domain entities, payment integration, complex state
      management. Tests whether Boop can handle real business logic
      and third-party API integration.
    profileOverrides:
      frontendFramework: next
      database: postgresql
    successCriteria:
      minPhaseReached: REVIEWING
      planningMustPass: true

  - id: t5-realtime-dashboard
    label: "T5: Real-time Dashboard"
    level: 5
    idea: >
      A real-time analytics dashboard with Next.js, WebSocket server,
      and interactive charts. Features: live data streaming via WebSockets,
      multiple chart types (line, bar, pie) with recharts, dashboard
      layout with drag-and-drop widgets, data source configuration,
      alert thresholds with notifications, historical data views.
    stack: "Next.js + WebSockets + charts"
    rationale: >
      Live data, complex UI state, bidirectional communication.
      Tests real-time architecture and complex frontend patterns.
    profileOverrides:
      frontendFramework: next
      database: postgresql
    successCriteria:
      minPhaseReached: REVIEWING
      planningMustPass: true

  - id: t6-saas-starter
    label: "T6: SaaS Starter"
    level: 6
    idea: >
      A SaaS starter kit with Next.js, PostgreSQL, multi-tenant
      architecture, and Stripe billing. Features: organization-based
      multi-tenancy with data isolation, subscription plans (free, pro,
      enterprise), usage-based billing with Stripe, team member
      invitation and role management, API key management, audit logging,
      admin super-panel for managing all tenants.
    stack: "Next.js + PostgreSQL + multi-tenant + billing"
    rationale: >
      The full complexity test. Multi-tenancy, billing integration,
      role hierarchies, and audit trails. If Boop can plan and build
      this coherently, it can handle real production workloads.
    profileOverrides:
      frontendFramework: next
      database: postgresql
    successCriteria:
      minPhaseReached: REVIEWING
      planningMustPass: true
