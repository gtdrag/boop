# Viability Assessment

## Project Idea

A simple task management API with CRUD operations.

## Technical Feasibility

This is a straightforward CRUD API that maps directly to the developer's preferred stack. No significant technical risks identified.

- **Complexity:** Low
- **Timeline estimate:** 1-2 days for MVP
- **Dependencies:** Standard — Express, PostgreSQL, TypeScript

## Market Fit

Task management is a well-understood domain. While the market is crowded, a focused API-first approach serves developer tooling use cases well.

## Risk Assessment

- **Technical risk:** Low — standard patterns, mature libraries
- **Scope risk:** Low — well-defined CRUD operations
- **Integration risk:** Low — REST API with standard auth

## Recommendation

**PROCEED**

This project is well-suited to the developer's stack and can be delivered quickly. The scope is clear and the technical approach is straightforward.
