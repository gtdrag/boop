# Viability Assessment Checklist

Use this checklist to validate that a viability assessment is thorough and actionable.

## Feasibility

- [ ] Technical feasibility assessed against the developer's specific tech stack
- [ ] Hard blockers identified (missing APIs, infrastructure limitations, licensing)
- [ ] Scope assessed relative to developer's stated skill level
- [ ] Third-party dependency risks evaluated (reliability, cost, rate limits)
- [ ] Score provided: High / Medium / Low

## Market Fit

- [ ] Target audience clearly identified
- [ ] Problem being solved is articulated (not just the solution)
- [ ] Existing alternatives acknowledged with differentiation
- [ ] Timing considerations addressed
- [ ] Score provided: High / Medium / Low

## Technical Complexity

- [ ] Overall difficulty rated: Low / Medium / High
- [ ] Riskiest components specifically named
- [ ] Established patterns vs novel approaches identified
- [ ] MVP timeline estimated (rough range, not precise dates)
- [ ] Level provided: Low / Medium / High

## Risks

- [ ] At least 3 concrete risks listed
- [ ] Each risk is specific (not generic "technical debt" or "scope creep")
- [ ] Risks are actionable — a developer can plan around them

## Recommendation

- [ ] Clear recommendation: PROCEED / CONCERNS / RECONSIDER
- [ ] Recommendation matches the scores (don't say PROCEED if feasibility is Low)
- [ ] Next steps are concrete and actionable
- [ ] If CONCERNS or RECONSIDER, specific changes to address issues are suggested

## Overall Quality

- [ ] Assessment references the developer profile (not generic advice)
- [ ] Honest about weaknesses — not just cheerleading
- [ ] Constructive — problems come with suggestions
- [ ] Concise — no padding or filler paragraphs
